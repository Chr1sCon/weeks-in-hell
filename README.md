## Deploying as a Container

To deploy this app as a container, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine. Once Docker is installed, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t weeks-in-hell .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container with persistent storage:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/local/folder:/usr/src/app/data weeks-in-hell
```

Now the app should be accessible at \`http://localhost:3000\`.

## Push to Docker Hub Script

### Usage:
- To auto-increment the version by 0.01:
  `./pushToDocker.sh`

- To specify a version manually:
  `./pushToDocker.sh 2.00`

### Docker compose example
```
version: "3.7"

services:
  weeks-in-hell:
    image: chr1scon/weeks-in-hell:latest
    container_name: weeks-in-hell
    restart: unless-stopped  
    volumes:
      - /home/chris/docker/weeks-in-hell/data:/usr/src/app/data   
    ports:
      - "3002:3002"
    environment:
      - TZ="Europe/Oslo"
    networks:
      macvlan:
        ipv4_address: 10.24.10.118

networks:
  macvlan:
    external: true
````

## Data Persistence

The app stores its data in a JSON file. If you're running the app as a Docker container, you'll want to map a local folder to the container to ensure that the JSON data persists.

1. Identify the path where the JSON file is stored within the container. As default, this should be /usr/src/app/data/.

2. Choose a local folder where you want to store the JSON file. For example, /Users/yourusername/weeks-in-hell-data.

3. Run the Docker container, mapping the local folder to the folder in the container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /Users/yourusername/weeks-in-hell-data:/app/data weeks-in-hell
```

This will ensure that the JSON file is saved on your local machine, even if the Docker container is stopped or removed.
